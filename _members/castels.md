Hannah earned her B.S. in Neuroscience from Georgia Tech and is currently pursuing her Ph.D. in Bioengineering. Her research focuses on the mechanisms of receptor signaling and how they are modulated by physical forces. By integrating mechanobiology into her work, she aims to uncover how cells interpret and respond to mechanical cues. Outside the lab, Hannah likes to bake, explore new cities, and daydream about her favorite cityâ€”Barcelona.
