Rasool holds dual B.Sc. degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering from Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, along with an M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology. His research focuses on T cell mechanobiology, particularly incorporating TCR proteins into nanodiscs. He is particularly interested in flow chamber experiments, where T cells or beads coated with TCRs (or nanodisc-TCR complexes) are flowed across a surface coated with pMHCs to analyze the kinetics between TCR and pMHC interactions.
