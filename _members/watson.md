Valencia earned her B.S in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Tech c/o 2016. She has also earned a M.S. in Chemical Engineering. She is currently pursuing a PhD in BioEngineering with the department of Biomedical Engineering. Her research interests are geared towards the intersection of T cell mechanobiology and cancer. Valencia aims to better understand how the tumor microenvironment impairs the TCR and which TME factors may be inducing changes in TCR mechanobiology. Furthermore, we aim to determine what role co-expression of tumor specific antigen and self protein has on TCR function
