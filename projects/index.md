We study a diverse array of cells from the immune system (e.g., T and B lymphocytes), cardiovascular system (e.g., platelets and endothelial cells), and nervous system (e.g., neurons and astrocytes). Our work focuses on key surface receptors, including adhesion molecules (e.g., selectins and integrins), immunoreceptors (e.g., TCR, BCR, PD-1, CD40), and synaptic receptors (e.g., glutamate delta receptor and neurexin), to understand how they mediate cellular communication and mechanotransduction.
