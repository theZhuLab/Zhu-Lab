# Welcome!

Welcome to the Zhu lab at Georgia Tech. We study single molecular adhesion with force spectroscopy for various cells and disease models. We pioneered in the discovery of force-prolonged bond lifetime, or the "catch bond," using the biomembrane force probe paired with mutation studies and molecular dynamics simulations.

## Highlights

Our goal is to understand how mechanical force influences enzyme-linked receptors, such as T cell receptors (TCRs) and B cell receptors (BCRs), to drive effective signal transduction.

By using tools like biomolecular force probes and molecular tension probes, we study the mechanobiology of single-molecule ligandâ€“receptor interactions and their downstream effects.
